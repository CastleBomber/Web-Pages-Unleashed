 *  Tips:
 *  Creates a React app with the contents a folder called frontend
 *  npx create-react-app@latest frontend --template redux
 *
 *  To get app running, affirm correct folder,
 *  npm run client <----use this one
 *  npm run server
 *  npm run dev - runs both server && client
 *
 *
 *  cmd+D will change opening and closing tag simultaneously
 *  cmd+D (+ D..) change multiple nearby instances of a name
 *  cors-heroku error: open https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo
 *
 *  Watch out for:
 *  In app, older syntax 'component', needs to be switched to 'element'
 *  older syntax of 'Switch', need to be 'Router' surrounding 'Route'
 *
 *  URL variables may need ending '/' added to function properly
